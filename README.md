# mccd-freebsd

These are shell scripts for installing all the dependencies of Minecraft Client in FreeBSD using pkg. 

If you're building Minecraft Client in FreeBSD from the ports, it is better that you install all of its dependencies using pkg, as that will greatly speed up the building process.

I made this by copying the dependencies from here:
https://ports.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=minecraft-client&stype=all

`mccd` stands for `minecraft client dependencies`

This is basically my other repository (https://github.com/4D32S5Y7Y3/mcsd-freebsd) but for Minecraft Client
